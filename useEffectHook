//Lifecycle methods
//1. Mounting
//2.Updating
//3.Unmounting

//useEffect
//Inside it we paas a function which runs only when the component mounts
Eg: When we have to get the data immediately when we make an API call



 useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component Mounted");
    
    return () => {
      console.log("Component Unmounted");
    }
  }, [])
  
  
  //If we want to execute an action only once when the component mounts, we put an empty array
  //If we want to exextute also when a state changes, then paas that in the array
  //If we want to execute an action when the component unmounts, then we return a function and that function will execute only when the component unmounts
  
  
  //React StrictMode
  With StrictMode, React forces the component to mount, then unmount immediately after, and then mount again to check if useEffect is working correctly
